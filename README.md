### My Research

I study intermittent streams. Research is done in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed where I have mapped the extent and location of stream drying. Additionally, my research is focused on further developing mechanistic understandings of what drives stream drying at the reach scale using subsurface flow measurements, water chemsitry measurements, and presence/absence of water measurements.

#### SMART Goals
| Specific      | Measureable | Acheivable  | Relevant | Time-bound |
| ------------- |:-----------:| :----------:| :-------:| :---------:|

1. Become fluent in creating and using github repositories. I will do this by creating a github repository with various folders containing python code used for environmental science. I will be fluent in downloading files from git hub, editing them, and committing them to the github repository. This repository will be in full use by the end of the semester. 
2. Develop python coding skills to perform environmental science tasks on many files (greater than 10) and large files (greater than 1000 rows of data). This includes the development of functions and workflows to pull data from some source (local, or through github), run the code, and deliever an output. 
3. Develop an understanding of greater than 5 applications of github/data science in computational earth science.
